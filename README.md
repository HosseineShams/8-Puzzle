# 8-Puzzle Game & Solver

this code is a sophisticated toolset tailored for enthusiasts of the classic 8-puzzle game. Whether you're a casual player or a puzzle researcher, this code offers both an interactive gameplay experience and a state-of-the-art IDA-Star (A*) algorithm to compute optimal solutions.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Experience the 8-puzzle in its raw form. Make moves, strategize, and challenge yourself.

- **IDA-Star (A*) Solver**: Our advanced IDA-Star algorithm ensures you're never stuck. Get optimal solutions for any solvable puzzle configuration in moments.

- **Solvable Configuration Detector**: Before diving into solving or playing, the code checks if the given puzzle configuration is even solvable, ensuring you don't chase the impossible.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Running the Game

#### Interactive Mode:
1. Execute `8-puzzle.py`.
2. Follow on-screen instructions to play. Use commands like 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right' to shuffle tiles.

#### Automated Solver Mode:
1. Launch `IDA-Star.py`.
2. Input your puzzle configuration.
3. Watch as the algorithm calculates and presents the optimal solution.

## üîç Behind the Scenes

8-Puzzle employs the IDA-Star (A*) algorithm, a renowned informed search algorithm that uses a combination of the cost to reach the current state and a heuristic estimate to reach the goal. This ensures not only the accuracy of the solution but also its optimality.
